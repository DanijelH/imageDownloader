# imageDownloader

If you ever visited certain website and thought to yourself, it would be great if I could just download all images from this website at once, this might interest you.

This is a simple wannabe image downloader that reads website source and tries to recreate image url's.

It has many bugs, sometimes it counts wrong, it was written in few hours while learning python, but for most websites, it works.
